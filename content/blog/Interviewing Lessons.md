- Be selective about the interviews you accept. (reference Glue work article)
- Know GPA and Clearance status
- Job hopper id?
- Team accomplishments or individual accomplishments? What was their exact role and contribution?
- Decades of experience can lead to distance from the keyboard. Drill into recent demontrations of technical expertise.
- Are they a "user" or an "understander"?
- A resume is supposed to be a guide for the interviewer to find what the interviewee is a rockstar at. Don't make me wade through a pile of languages and technologies you touched once or twice and don't understand. I'm not hiring a language-specific dev. I'm hiring a brilliant software engineer. Help me see this by only showing me what demonstrates your deep understanding and expertise.
- Code Tests
- Less helpful: single difficult logic problem without internet. (whiteboard dynamic programming challenge)
- More helpful: simulate work environment. Internet available. Build tools available. Start with simple task that iterates to get more and more complex. Shouldn't take more than 30 min to discern if someone is comfortable on the command line and with their language.
- Not as the only data point, but can really bring some valuable insight into the capability of a developer to put into practice the buzzwords they may be kicking out.
