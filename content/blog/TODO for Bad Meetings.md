Signs you are in a bad meeting:
1. Others are disengaged
2. YOU are disengaged
3. Action items are convoluted and unclear

Some reasons:

1. Keep getting pulled into niche conversations that don't involve everyone
2. The relevance for the current conversation is not communicated clearly
3. The risk for 1&2 increase as the number of topics covered in a single meeting increases

**What expectations can others uphold?**
Please don't schedule events during the scheduled time of the meeting
Please don't start work during the meeting

**What expectations can I uphold?**

Prevent niche conversations
Clearly communicate relevance of current topics to all parties

How do I handle large meetings like Sprint Review + Planning?

- Break them up
- Clearly state purpose for each "section" of the meeting
- This requires you to know the sections of the meeting and their purposes.
- Introduce a powerpoint that defines the sections of the meeting and progresses through them visually as the meeting advances.
- Aggressively table conversations not relevant to all parties
- Tasking directions? These probably don't matter to all parties, so would be best to communicate these offline?
