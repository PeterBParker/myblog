What are the skills of a great software engineer?

1. Engineering Leadership

2. Team strategy

3. Collecting Reqs and converting to features and then tasks

4. Tracking vision and purpose of the entire project

5. Technical Knowledge

6. Techniques/design patterns that lead to better code faster

7. Technologies and products that allow you to ship features faster instead of rolling your own X

8. Choosing the correct database tech that is optimized for your data and use cases

9. Big Picture Thinking

10. Working your way back from the end result so that you can deliver what needs to be delivered on time and within budget

11. Thinking through all constraints and edge cases to prevent one or two redesigns (or three or four...)

12. Business Integration

13. Writing effective and concise documentation and user guides

14. Understanding the ecosystem your product will integrate into

15. Understanding the component integration contracts

  

How to be better at #2?

1. Humility. Learning attitude. Learn from everyone. Learn everywhere.

2. Don't do management.

3. Spend the time to understand WHY something works more than getting it TO work

4. Obviously we get paid to deliver working features/products, but neglecting the deeper understanding leads to poorer quality and more frustrating debugging

5. Be around engineers that are better than you

6. They must be able to mentor you and not steal tasks/glory/be a crutch

7. Be in a workplace that empowers you and makes it safe to learn (aka safe to fail)

8. Pair programming with engineers that are better than you

9. Regular exposure Technical reading/ideas

10. Exposure to different code bases and purposes. Establishes a broader horizon of how to solve a problem and what kinds of problems are worth solving.

11. Engineer code. Don't just write it. Don't just perfect it. Write code the best you can to deliver in a timely manner and get burned by your own code to learn what matters in design and what doesn't.

12. Know database technologies and intenrals will take you really far. Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"

13. Know your tools really well (language, debugger, IDE, etc.)

12.
