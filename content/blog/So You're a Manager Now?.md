So you ignored my advice and you decided to become a manager. Kiss your technical chops goodbye, my friend. This is the beginning of the end. (Just kidding...kinda)

  

What is your role?

1. Get this answered very explicitly at your company

2. Where I'm at it's

3. Be the representative of the company to the direct report

4. Communicate changes and updates

5. Gather feedback and frustration and gratitude

6. Be the representative of the direct report to the company

7. Have their back

8. Get them out of bad situations. Place them in positions they can flourish.

9. Pour as much value as you can give back into them

10. Professional development plans (if they want them)

11. Ignite dreams and visions of possible futures (if they care)

12. Offer opportunities and conference trips and stretch assignments

13. Advocate for them

14. Get them raises and bonus and accolades

15. Abstract away as much of their admin stuff as possible

16. Time charging questions

17. Reimbursement questions

18. Where to find forms or insurance cards or whatever

19. They want to get their work done. You want them to see you as an accelerate for them instead of a friction point.
