I love making stuff! Currently writing sweet servers at work and a graphic novel at home. Latest book recommendation: 
- Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke.
- Mythmakers by John Hendrix
- Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann

Check out the creative projects I do with my super-talented and wickedly-sweet wife at [Veiltorn Studios](https://www.veiltornstudios.com) or our webcomic [Monsters And Myriads](https://www.monstersandmyriads.com) for its five year anniversary this year!
